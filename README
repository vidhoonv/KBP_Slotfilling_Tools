KBP Slotfilling (SF) SECOND RUN
===============================
In the KBP slot filling task, to provide scope for inference component to kick in, we generate queries from the response generated for the official queries. This provides more information about the slot fills of original queries which can potentially initiate more inference rules.

The python script in this repo can be used to extract these new query entities out from the response file of a KBP SF system. Then, the SF system can be run on this new query file to produce more slot fills for using in inference.

Usage:


Note:
USAGE:
python extract_secondset_queries.py <OUTPUT_OF_ORIGINAL_QUERIES> <NEW_QUERIES_FILE.XML>

Known issues:
Some queries had "&" character in their text which created problem in XML file. So I removed "&" manually.
